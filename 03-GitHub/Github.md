Github is one of the most popular version control systems. It is an online platform where developers can store and share their code with other developers. It provides an easy way to manage and collaborate on code, as well as track changes to the code over time. With GitHub, developers can create repositories to store their code, work together on the same codebase, and track issues and bugs that need to be fixed. Additionally, GitHub provides a variety of tools and integrations that make it easy to automate workflows, deploy code, and create CI/CD pipelines.
