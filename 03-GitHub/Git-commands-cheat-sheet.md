# MOST USED GIT COMMANDS

* git checkout: Switch between branches
* git commit -m "your message here": Commits the staged snapshot of the files to the project history.
* git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message": Helps you fix the most recent commit messages
* git commit --amend: This command is also used for making changes to the most recent commit. When run a brand new commit is made and the previous one is deleted so do not use this command in public commits if other developers have based their work on.
