# Devops Foundations
This repository will offer an understanding of Devops concepts as well as the most commonly used tools by Devops Engineers.
There are numerous resources on the net for learning and mastering Devops tools.You can follow this repo, find other reources yourself or refer to courses offered by platforms like Udemy, Linkedin Learning or even coding bootcamps. But the trick of learning Devops is to set your goals and start at a point where you will continuously dedicate yourself in learning them without backing up. The field is so vast and the knowledge required is so rich that you have to really give 100% in order to fully understand Devops.
## Organization of the Repo
There are many repos where you can find day to day offerings of learning material. Instead, I am planning to follow a subject basis approach. After providing an overall understanding of Devops, I will offer common subjects that needed to be learned by every developer and then the tools required to be learned by mainly Devops engineers.

## Revisions
In time, I will be visiting and revising all of the documents mainly depending on the feedback I receive.

So, buckle up and enjoy the Devops ride!
