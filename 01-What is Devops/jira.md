## What is Jira?

Jira is like a to-do tool that is used by software development teams. It helps everyone to keep track of the work and tasks.

Jira helps the teams to be transparent, efficient, and collaborative.

"Transparency means everyone on your team can see what work is getting done. Efficiency means your team can plan ahead by knowing exactly when work will start and end. Collaboration means working closely with your teammates, keeping discussions and comments well-organized." Atlassian University

## Roles in Jira

You are either an administrator or a user in Jira. In Jira, work items are called issues (Some companies may call them tickets, requests, or tasks)

* Users: Keep track of and update issues. Every time you complete a work you update the issues. If you have a question regarding that, you update the issues. You place the issues under in-progress or done sections.
* Admins: Create issues

## Concepts in Jira

* Project: A project is a collection of issues. You can name your projects as you wish. For example, you can use team name. You can switch between projects from the Projects dropdown menu on the top navigation bar.
* Board: A board is a visual display of your work progress. There are different types of boards that you can use in Jira, such as Kanban board and scrum board. (You can choose boards from the left project sidebar.)
* Issue cards: They are actually issues which are individual work items.
* Board columns: Depending on how you structure it, boards have several columns. Most widely used are to do, in progress, in review and done columns.
* Workflow: All the columns of a board presents a workflow. Starting from to do and ending with done, the boards actually display workflows.
* Kanban boards vs scrum boards: Kanban is used by all types of teams whereas scrum is mostly used by software development teams.
* Board name: Projects may have multiple boards and each board is named individually. You can see all of the boards from the left navigation pane by clicking on dropdown menu.
