# AWS overview
AWS provides a broad set of infrastructure services, such as computing power, storage options, networking, and databases. AWS was first launched in 2006 by Amazon.com and has since been the leading cloud platform in the world.

AWS operates in multiple regions around the world. Each of these regions consist of multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Each AZ is a physically seperate data center, consisting of one or more discrete data centers, with its own power, networking, and connectivity. This ensures that applications running in different AZs are highly available and resillient to failures.

You can find information regarding the most updated list of regions and AZs on AWS website (https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/?p=ngi&loc=0).

As of 2023, there are 31 regions with a total of 99 AZs throughout the world. Also, there are more than 400 edge locations. Currently, AWS serving a total of 245 countries and territories.
