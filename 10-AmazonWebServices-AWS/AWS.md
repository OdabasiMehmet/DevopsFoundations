Cloud Services
IT industry has shifted towards cloud based solutions in almost every field. There are many cloud providers, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud which provide all types of cloud solutions for IT professionals. As a Devops professional, it is imperative to master at least one of these cloud services. 

The general idea behind these cloud services are almost the same. Therefore, understanding one of  these services in great detail gives an idea on how to work with other providers. Although the particular service names differ among cloud providers, the architecture of the systems are very similar. 

In this repository, I will provide information regarding AWS, because I think it is the most widely used cloud service by IT professionals.
